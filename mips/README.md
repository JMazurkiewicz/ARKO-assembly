# MIPS projects

## Running

To run MIPS programs use [MARS MIPS simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).

You can download `Mars.jar` directly [here](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/MARS_4_5_Aug2014/Mars4_5.jar) or use `tools/install-mars.sh` script:

```bash
./tools/install-mars.sh [optional path]
```

## Training

The `training` directory contains various programs written in MIPS assembly. Their functionalities are described in corresponding file's name.

## Main project

The goal is to create program transforming raw file into C-like array of bytes (`unsigned char[]`). The example of such transformations is in `main-project/output.txt` file (the original file is in `main-project/input.txt`).

## Scores

* Small MIPS project: 3/3
* Main MIPS project: 6/6

## Comments

Comments in `C.asm` file are written in Polish language, the language of the course. You can easily translate them to English with Google Translate.
